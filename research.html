   The coil&#8211;globule transition of aqueous polymers is of profound significance in understanding the structure and
function of responsive soft matter. In particular, the remarkable effect of amphiphilic cosolvents (e.g., alcohols) that
leads to both swelling and collapse of stimuli-responsive polymers has been hotly debated in the literature,
often with contradictory mechanisms proposed. A predominant focus in the literature has been placed on
the role of polymer&#8211;cosolvent attractive interactions whereas the role of <span 
class="cmti-10">excluded volume interactions</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">(repulsive interactions) </span>has been largely neglected. Using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy
calculations, we demonstrated that alcohols <span 
class="cmti-10">preferentially adsorb </span>on the polymer and reduce the free energy
cost of creating a repulsive polymer&#8211;solvent interface via a <span 
class="cmti-10">surfactant-like mechanism </span>which surprisingly
<span 
class="cmti-10">drives polymer collapse </span>at low alcohol concentrations. This hitherto neglected role of interfacial solvation
thermodynamics is common to all coil&#8211;globule transitions, and rationalized the experimentally observed effects
of higher alcohols and polymer molecular weight on the coil-to-globule transition of thermoresponsive
polymers. Further, we showed that polymer&#8211;(co)solvent attractive interactions reinforce or compensate
this mechanism and it is this interplay which drives polymer swelling or collapse. The surfactant-like
mechanism proposed in our study is generic and applicable to other polymer solutions containing amphiphilic
cosolvents.

nonadditive. Our study focused on this nonadditive effect on the coil-to-globule of PNIPAM using large scale

(NaI-Na<sub><span

   The ability of various cosolutes and cosolvents, in aqueous solutions, to enhance or quench interfacial solvent density
fluctuations have crucial implications on the conformational equilibrium of macromolecules such as polymers and
proteins. Therefore characterizing the thermodynamics of the solvation shell and their dependence on stimuli such as
cosolvent/cosolute concentration is very important. The small system method (SSM) exploits the unique
nature of finite sized open systems in which, <span 
class="cmti-10">thermodynamic quantities scale with the inverse system size</span>.
This scaling allows for the <span 
class="cmti-10">accurate estimation of properties </span>in the thermodynamic limit in finite size
simulations. Our study extends the SSM to characterize the thermodynamics of the hydration shell of a model
extended hydrophobic solute in water and water-urea/methanol mixtures. In parallel, our other study was
aimed at computing the contribution to the solvation free energy arising from fluctuating solute-solvent
cohesive interactions which is known as &#8220;Fluctuation entropy&#8221;. The fluctuation entropy is usually computed
through <span 
class="cmti-10">indirect or approximate methods </span>which are not applicable to solutes with <span 
class="cmti-10">flexible conformational</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">degrees of freedom </span>such as macromolecules. This study proposed a direct method based on the indirect
umbrella sampling (INDUS) method to <span 
class="cmti-10">directly compute the fluctuation entropy </span>which can be applied to
macromolecules.

   Osmolytes such as Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) regulate the thermodynamic stability of proteins and
polymers, and are shown to play an important role in biological systems. The effect of TMAO on the solvation of
nonpolar solutes is not well understood. Our study focused on the effect of TMAO on the hydrophobic hydration and
hydrophobic interactions of &#8220;small&#8221; and &#8220;large&#8221; hydrophobic solutes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
free-energy calculations. Interestingly, the simulation data indicated the occurrence of a <span 
class="cmti-10">length scale crossover </span>in the
TMAO interaction with repulsive Weeks&#8211;Chandler&#8211;Andersen (WCA) solutes: while TMAO is <span 
class="cmti-10">depleted </span>from the
hydration shell of a <span 
class="cmti-10">small WCA solute </span>(methane) and increases the free-energy cost of solute-cavity formation, it <span 
class="cmti-10">preferentially binds </span>to a <span 
class="cmti-10">large WCA solute </span>(<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>-helical polyalanine), reducing the free-energy cost of solute-cavity
formation via a <span 
class="cmti-10">surfactant-like mechanism</span>. Significantly, the study shows that this surfactant-like behaviour of TMAO
reinforces the solvent-mediated attraction between large WCA solutes by means of an entropic force
linked to the interfacial accumulation of TMAO. It therefore <span 
class="cmti-10">favours </span>solute&#8211;solute contact states that
<span 
class="cmti-10">minimise the surface area </span>exposed to the solvent and have a small overall number of TMAO molecules
adsorbed.
