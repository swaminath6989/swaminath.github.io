\section*{Research Highlights}

\paragraph{\textbf{Cosolvent Effects on the Phase Behavior of Responsive Polymers:}}
The coilâ€“globule transition of aqueous polymers is of profound significance in
understanding the structure and function of responsive soft matter. In
particular, the remarkable effect of amphiphilic cosolvents (e.g., alcohols)
that leads to both swelling and collapse of stimuli-responsive polymers has
been hotly debated in the literature, often with contradictory mechanisms
proposed. A predominant focus in the literature has been placed on the role of
polymerâ€“cosolvent attractive interactions whereas the role of \textit{excluded
volume interactions (repulsive interactions)} has been largely neglected.
Using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, we
demonstrated that alcohols \textit{preferentially adsorb} on the polymer and
reduce the free energy cost of creating a repulsive polymerâ€“solvent interface
via a \textit{surfactant-like mechanism} which surprisingly \textit{drives
polymer collapse} at low alcohol concentrations. This hitherto neglected role
of interfacial solvation thermodynamics is common to all coilâ€“globule
transitions, and rationalized the experimentally observed effects of higher
alcohols and polymer molecular weight on the coil-to-globule transition of
thermoresponsive polymers. Further, we showed that polymerâ€“(co)solvent
attractive interactions reinforce or compensate this mechanism and it is this
interplay which drives polymer swelling or collapse. The surfactant-like
mechanism proposed in our study is generic and applicable to other polymer
solutions containing amphiphilic cosolvents.

\paragraph{\textbf{Salt Effects on the Coil-to-Globule Transitions of
Thermoresponsive Polymers:}} The anion Hofmeister series classifies anions in
order of their ability to salt out proteins: CO$_3^{2-}$ $>$ SO$_4^{2-}$ $>$
S$_2$O$_3^{2-}$ $>$ H$_2$PO$_4^{-}$ $>$ F$^{-}$ $>$ Cl$^{-}$ $>$ Br$^{-}$
NO$_3^{-}$ $>$ I$^{-}$ $>$ ClO$_4^{-}$ $>$ SCN$^{-}$.  Specifically, anions on
the right hand side of this series are \textit{weakly hydrated} and
\textit{partition to nonpolar surfaces} such as polymer/water or air-water
interfaces  On the other hand, \textit{strongly hydrated} anions (left hand
side of the series) tend to \textit{strongly interact with water} molecules and
remain in the bulk water environment. Recent experiments have indicated that
the combined effect of a weakly hydrated and a strongly hydrated anion on the
lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)(PNIPAM) is nonadditive. Our study focused on this
nonadditive effect on the coil-to-globule of PNIPAM using large scale atomistic
simulations. The simulations were able to capture the experimentally observed
effect of mixed salts (NaI-Na$_{2}$SO$_{4}$) on the coil-globule equilibrium of
PNIPAM. Interestingly, the predicted change in LCST as a function of salt
concentration from simulations, through a semi-quantitative analysis, is in
quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. We showed that
nonadditive ion effects on the coil-to-globule transitions of PNIPAM arise due
to the interplay between \textit{depletion of the strongly hydrated sulfate
ions} and the preferential accumulation of the iodide ions on the polymer
leading to \textit{favourable {\rm PNIPAM}-{\rm I}$^{-}$ interactions}. This
correlates with the \textit{partitioning of the {\rm Na}$^{+}$ cations} from
the counterion cloud of the weakly hydrated iodide ions to the counterion cloud
of the strongly hydrated sulfate ions. The proposed mechanism is applicable to
other solutions containing a mixture of a weakly hydrated and strongly hydrated
anion.

\paragraph{\textbf{Hydrophobic Length Scale Dependence of Osmolyte Effects:}}
Osmolytes such as Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) regulate the thermodynamic
stability of proteins and polymers, and are shown to play an important role in
biological systems. The effect of TMAO on the solvation of nonpolar solutes is
not well understood. Our study focused on the effect of TMAO on the
hydrophobic hydration and hydrophobic interactions of \enquote{small} and
\enquote{large} hydrophobic solutes using  molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
and free-energy calculations. Interestingly, the simulation data indicated the
occurrence of a \textit{length scale crossover} in the TMAO interaction with
repulsive Weeksâ€“Chandlerâ€“Andersen (WCA) solutes: while TMAO is
\textit{depleted} from the hydration shell of a \textit{small WCA solute}
(methane) and increases the free-energy cost of solute-cavity formation, it
\textit{preferentially binds} to a \textit{large WCA solute} ($\alpha$-helical
polyalanine), reducing the free-energy cost of solute-cavity formation via a
\textit{surfactant-like mechanism}. Significantly, the study shows that this
surfactant-like behaviour of TMAO reinforces the solvent-mediated attraction
between large WCA solutes by means of an entropic force linked to the
interfacial accumulation of TMAO.   It therefore \textit{favours} soluteâ€“solute
contact states that \textit{minimise the surface area} exposed to the solvent
and have a small overall number of TMAO molecules adsorbed.

\paragraph{\textbf{Solvation Shell Thermodynamics:}}
The ability of various cosolutes and cosolvents, in aqueous solutions,  to
enhance or quench interfacial solvent density fluctuations have crucial
implications on the conformational equilibrium of macromolecules such as
polymers and proteins. Therefore characterizing the thermodynamics of the
solvation shell and their dependence on stimuli such as cosolvent/cosolute
concentration is very important. The small system method (SSM) exploits the
unique nature of finite sized open systems in which, \textit{thermodynamic
quantities scale with the inverse system size}.  This scaling allows for the
\textit{accurate estimation of properties} in the thermodynamic limit in finite
size simulations.  Our study extends the SSM to characterize the thermodynamics
of the hydration shell of a model extended hydrophobic solute in water and
water-urea/methanol mixtures. In parallel, our other study was aimed at
computing the contribution to the solvation free energy arising from
fluctuating solute-solvent cohesive interactions which is known as
\enquote{Fluctuation entropy}. The fluctuation entropy is usually computed
through \textit{indirect or approximate methods} which are not applicable to
solutes with \textit{flexible conformational degrees of freedom} such as
macromolecules. This study proposed a direct method based on the indirect
umbrella sampling (INDUS) method to \textit{directly compute the fluctuation
entropy} which can be applied to macromolecules.
